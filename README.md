# 👋 Hello! My name is Caio Nery

I’m a **C#/.NET backend developer**, constantly evolving.  
Currently, I focus my studies on **ASP.NET Core**, **Entity Framework Core**, **SQL Server**, and **Azure DevOps (Deploy & CI/CD)**, always applying best practices such as **Dependency Injection**, **DTOs**, **AutoMapper**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **unit testing with xUnit and Moq**, **SOLID principles**, and **Clean Code**.
